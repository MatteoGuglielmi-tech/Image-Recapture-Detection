\subsection{Classification}
At this level of implementation, the SVM has already been trained and the model stored.\\
This part of implementation consists of testing the SVM on the test set in order to adress its performances.\\
By analogy with the training phase, this part's explanation is structured in points as well :
\begin{itemize}
    \item the first step consists in extracting the path of all images used for test, both recaptured and single captured, shot by all the cameras;
    \item for each picture, the feature extraction process is performed and the ouput is saved within a .csv file equivalently to the training part;
    \item consequently, a predition is carried out on each image and the results are showed in a table which exhibits: the amount of correctly and erroneously classified rate and the accuracy achieved for each camera model.\\
          Furthermore, the confusion matrix for each camera is video-printed, where :
          \begin{itemize}
              \item the first element represents the True Negatives (images correctly classified as Single Captured);
              \item the first element represents the False Negatives (images wrongly classified as Single Captured);
              \item the first element represents the True Positives (images correctly classified as Recaptured);
              \item the first element represents the False Positives (images wrongly classified as Recaptured);
          \end{itemize}
            It is noteworthy to adress that in order to obtain independent statistics, the classification process is performed separately on each camera model's test set.
\end{itemize}
